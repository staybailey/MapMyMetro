> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Restructure Metro. 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  The market is transportation nerds and public officials (and thier constiuents) who would benefit from having effective tools to visualize, reason about and reiterate
  service restructures to bus systems that are intended to make service more useful to more people and eliminate low preforming service.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  The product allows users to modify their city's bus system by adding new routes, changing frequency, stop patterns or other details of a route, or deleting routes. The product
  will display the existing system on a map and users will be able to create new routes (including non-grid dependent "subway" services) or change existing routes. In addition users can impose constraints, notably the (approximate) amount of service hours (effectively money) required to implement revised service. When the user revises the system, the product can display "Freedom of movement" by allowing users to select a point and see how far they can travel with a heat map like display. Red areas would be areas the user can get to quickly and bluer areas are places it would be hard to reach from the given origin selected

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Due to status quo bias, loss aversion and naivity regarding transit geometry and best practices, transit agencies have a difficult time convincing the public of the utility of revising their service to benefit more constituents (i.e. increase ridership). In particular, people have a hard time understanding the constraints of the problem (the "I want 
  more things for less money" problem and people have a hard time visualizing the network effects (which lead to higher ridership) of higher frequency service). In addition, people generally like to think about building out a rail system, and this tool will also provide people a canvass for doing that and visualizing how it might integrate with
  the existing transit system.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This tool would be able to make that process more seemless by giving constituents better ways of 
  actually visualizing how given proposed changes will change thier mobility as well as general mobility in the city. In addition, the service will allow people to easily reason
  about the system/revenue implications of making a change different from the one they propose.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  This product is THE tool for transit agencies and consultants to use to help demonstrate the clear benefits of service revisions to a skeptical public

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just click and drag to draw that dream route or rail line you always wish your city had.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "This product made it easy for me to see that with Metro's propesed restructure, I'd have convenient access to neighborhoods I could have only reached by car before"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
